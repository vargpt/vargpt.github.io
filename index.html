    		Hi, I'm Varun and this is my academic website. I am a graduate student in the Computer Science
    		department at the University of Pennsylvania, where I have the pleasure of being advised by Michael
    		Kearns and Aaron Roth.
    		<br> <br>
    		My research interests are in machine learning and algorithmic game theory. I am motivated by 
    		improving considerations of fairness, privacy, and robustness in practical systems. I am also
    		interested in technology policy and in particular, operationalizing legal concepts in this sphere by making them technically rigorous.
    		<br> <br>
    		I was fortunate to start research early as a student thanks to support by all my mentors. 
            I enjoy helping students learn about research, so please get in touch if you want to discuss my work!
